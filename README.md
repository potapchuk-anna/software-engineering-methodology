In order to run the project you should
1. Go to folder lab1
2. Write command `dotnet run` to run project

How it works
1. First of all you should write name of file with test cases (pay attention, it's better to set this file in lab1 folder in order to find it easly)
2. After that program will return you one or two lines for each test case:
- In first line you'll see 1 if black wins, 2 if white wins, and 0 if nobody wins yet.
- If black or white won, in the second line you'll see the horizontal line number and the vertical line number of the leftmost stone among the five consecutive stones.
